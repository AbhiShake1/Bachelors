      Technology has changed our lives by increasing the speed of time. We were
      human. We invented and developed the technologies to change our lives to
      their best. Now that technology is changing our lives every second.
      Technology is in the air, water, food, education, business, office,
      electricity, marketing, data storage, communication, cars, parking,
      traveling, foods, shopping, and banks etc. It’s almost everywhere and in
      everything that is involved in our daily life. Technology is the king and
      human is a slave. But if a slave is clever, knowledgeable enough then they
      can manipulate the king (technologies). Let's learn how technologies has
      changed our lives in the following article:

          Technology changed the ways of education and learning methods. We are
          not able in the past to get data, information, and knowledge so
          quickly with flexibility. The school was very far from home. We
          learned that was not interesting in certain ways. But today because of
          technology there are online schools. Anyone can do degrees online by
          using the internet and computers. There are various types of online
          courses for everyone with different contents. If you’re interested,
          learn more: Online Basic Computer Courses – Learn Essential Computer
          Skills This is how has technology changed education. It is a positive
          change. Even after machine learning, it’s highly possible that robots
          and machines start contributing to training people.<br />Tap on

          Today we have mobile, internet, computer and social media, video
          conferencing tools, and mobile apps to communicate with anyone around
          the world. It was not possible in the past. The benefit of
          communication change is that it’s the fast, easy and quickest method
          to communicate. In the past, a letter takes 10 days to reach the
          destination such as money order, greeting cards, personal letter and
          thousands of other communication sources are not fast enough. But
          technologies changed that now you can send an email. You can transfer
          the money from your mobile phone. This is a technology and it’s
          non-stop.<br />Tap on rightmost arrow to go to next point, leftmost

        <p>
          With technology changes, we got new kind of habits and it’s tough for
          parents to solve such kind of problems. It’s because they don’t know
          the solutions. Most of the kids, teens are addicted to the internet.
          For them, technology is a toy. This can be a good change, but what
          about creativity and their brain development. Is artificial
          intelligence is the new tool of creativity? I don’t think so. And
          after 20 years, the Internet will be boring for them. Then they will
          use robots for their works as today we’re using the internet or
          Google. The frequently touted remedy is a “digital detox” – banning
          yourself from connectivity for hours or days at a time. But that can
          have the perverse effect of making the banned object more enticing.
          What I love about Ditto is that it makes my phone boring: if I know
          I’ll be buzzed for the important stuff, where’s the excitement in
          checking it?<br />Tap on rightmost arrow to go to next point, leftmost

          Technology has a positive and negative impact on our daily life. Today
          we live more appearance filled the life. We do online shopping and
          there are varieties and price comparison tools. Technologies have an
          internet of things that anyone can use in their daily life. We are
          busier than productive. 30 years ago people used to have time for
          friends and families. At the same time, they are emotional, care of
          nature and humanity. Today, we do the same things on social media but
          without emotions. This is a technological effect. And we’re
          responsible for this change. It’s is good or bad, depends on the
          users, how they’re using it.<br />Tap on rightmost arrow to go to next

          Technology has increased the pace of our life, but the quality is
          reduced. Technology impacted our life positively and negatively. Today
          we have more health care technologies then past. But the reason,
          behind the inventions of health technologies, is the overuse of
          technology in daily life. In old times people have less electric
          equipment for house and fieldwork. In the old-time people, physical
          stamina is better than today’s fitness freaks. They lived their life
          longer without technology but today after technology the average human
          age is reducing. We’re greedy and we want more, faster and in fewer
          efforts. That’s why business God is selling air purifier, mineral
          waters more confidently other than inspiring humans to plant trees and
          grow natural sources. Even after the technological development in
          medical science, doctors are not confident in sayings about life is
          safe for a patient after an operation in certain cases.

          Today most of the people do not invent, they do business to solve
          people problem. They can sell anything and every human being is
          targeted, customers. They are collecting data, what you search, where
          you click, what you buy, how you react to certain copywriter’s text.
          This is impacting our life because they are creating products based on
          our search results and technologies habits. All are doing searches,
          everyone wants to read the easy explanation, people don’t have time to
          think, and they do searches. Why think? When there are search engines
          who give even instant suggestions to search this or that. We‘re not
          able to think critically that’s why we are inventing artificial
          intelligence for the future generation. The positive is we can get
          knowledge and information and data by using technology. But the
          negative is too much data, an overload of information and overuse of
          technology equipment making us addict to the tech tools. We can’t
          analyze, understand easily without seeing visual examples. This is how
          I think technology is impacting our critical thinking.<br />Tap on
